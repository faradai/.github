### Coverage
Deepen your expertise of DeFi risk mitigation and the DeFi cover industry.

- **Protocol Coverage.** Protection against losses resulting from the use of a DeFi protocol, such as smart contract
exploits and/or hacks, economic design failure, attacks leveraging oracle data manipulation and governance attacks (malicious players gaining enough voting power to reshape protocol rules, leading to a loss of funds).

- **Custody Coverage.** Protection against losses resulting from the use of a centralized or custodial (CeFi)
cryptocurrency product (e.g. wallet, cryptobot). This protection against custodian exploits and/or hacks, fund mismanagement, and account lock-ups (inability to access funds without prior notification from the custodian).

- **Stablecoin Depeg Coverage.** Protection against losses resulting from a stablecoin (e.g. aquaUSD) losing its peg to
its target fiat currency (e.g. USD), resulting in the userâ€™s inability to redeem a stablecoin for the intended amount of its pegged currency. This protection against pre-specified drops in price.

- **Yield Token Cover.** Protection against losses resulting from the face value of a yield-bearing token (e.g. hTON)
significantly diverging from its market value in a reference currency (e.g. TON). This broader protection than protocol cover, by safeguarding against failures in a potential chain of protocols composed to generate yield.
